### "To be a macOS App Developer"

___
#### Introduction
"The self-taught projects"<br>
I follow the latest trends & technology in the market. <br>I make sure my code is of production quality.<br>

___
#### #1: MarkdownEditor - like TextEdit, Pages, Numbers apps.
- This is a document-based app/ purely macOS application.<br>
- The app allows users to: write formatted text quickly and easily.<br>And it can be converted into HTML for displaying but is much more convenient to write and edit,<br> with: The HTML preview, a toolbar, menus, and allow app to use either ".md/ .markdown/ .mdown" for the file extensions.<br>
- Currently, the application supports 2 languages: English and Vietnamese.<br>

##### Conveniences: 

- The HTML preview and a Settings window for the ability to change the editor font size:

- A Cheatsheet menu item within an Help existing menu:

- A completely new menu - StyleSheet for change to a different stylesheet:

- A Toolbar: controls to switch between three preview models: web, HTML, off - hidden.

- Expecially, on macOS 12 or above, using AttributedString that could be formatted using Markdown and make the text inside Text views selectable.
